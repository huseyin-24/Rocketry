## Objective
Since the fins of a rocket is excited by the surrounding air during its flight, they are dynamiclly loaded by the air modelues. This dynamic loading requires the fins to be 
designed according to its flutter speed, which is the speed resulting in natural frequency excititaion. Therefore, it is a must to analyze and compare the fin flutter speed 
and expected rocket speed during its flight. 

### Here is the fin flutter analysis part submitted for IREC2025 competition:
